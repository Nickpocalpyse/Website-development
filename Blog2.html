<h1>Strange sounds...</h1>
<p>So I was able to say I was going over to a friend's house!  Dad was  strangely allowing it for once...But hey, it worked out in the end!  So far, it's been mostly quiet except when I tried to sleep.  I heard scratching above me in the attic...I'm going to check it out now; wish me luck!</p>
