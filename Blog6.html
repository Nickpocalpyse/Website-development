          <p>I wasn't expecting mom to allow me to stay over at my "friends" for a weekend, but she did...I was gonna ask my dad, but he wasn't anywhere to be seen again... No matter though!  The first night has been interesting...A lot of chalk lines and tape.  I've been hiding underground in thhe market... found it through a secrect spot.  surprised the cops didnt have this way blocked off too!  More updates tomorrow!</p>
