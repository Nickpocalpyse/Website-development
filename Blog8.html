          <p>Hey y'all,  I left the evidence out for the police to see, and they found the murderer, so that's awesome!  But the main reason I wanted to post this is that I might be going on hiatus soon...TBH, my dad has gone missing.  I got called home to my mom in a panic when she couldn't reach him, and since he hasn't come home for a few days... I'll update you guys soon...</p>
